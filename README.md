## What is the mission of EMPOWERIT?
The mission of this project is to spread awareness of the inequality that is going on around us. There is not just one or two, but multiple types of inequality. Our mission is to educate people about different Inequalities that center around Identity Based, Career and Future, and Policies inequality. We are also planning on putting other peopleâ€™s experiences, stories, opinions, famous quotes, and perspectives into the website. Our mission is to create awareness and provide resources for the people who need them.

## What is our Goal?
Our goal for EmpowerIt is to create awareness and provide resources in order to decrease the inequality around us. Our world has so many problems and a lot of them can be solved, so why not solve them. Inequality is an issue that has been going on for centuries, and it is not something that we cannot solve. Our goal is to reduce some of this inequality by creating awareness, spreading stories, and providing resources in order to decrease the inequality that we can solve.
